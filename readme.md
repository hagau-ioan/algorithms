### Steps
1. Understand the requirements
2. Draw a simple case of the problem to understand the logic which will help you to solve the problem.
3. Create a list of input data containing how many edge cases are possible.
4. If the solution is working, think to a better optimisation for big O (speed, memory).
   - Sometimes using a huge amount of input data will require an optimisation.

# Algoritmi TODO:

1. Problem to match the parantessies to close each other: use a stak of elements and to find the pair
2. dynamic programming: memozision -->  hashtables, list, set
3. manipulate multiple pointers at same time: ex: a string which require to maniula from first to last and from last to first. The longest palindormin substring into a string. Traverse the fisrt string. Start frm the middle and go into left and right and to check the words: could be a merge sort ideea?
4. mirror a binary tree: left <-> right
