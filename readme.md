### Steps
1. Understand the requirements
2. Draw a simple case of the problem to understand the logic which will help you to solve the problem.
3. Create a list of input data containing how many edge cases are possible.
4. If the solution is working, think to a better optimisation for big O (speed, memory).
   - Sometimes using a huge amount of input data will require an optimisation.
